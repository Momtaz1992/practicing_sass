Learning Sass Project
Welcome to my Learning Sass project! This repository serves as a personal learning playground where I explore and practice Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) by working on a project entirely built using Sass.

What is Sass?
Sass is a powerful and popular CSS preprocessor that extends the capabilities of regular CSS. It introduces features like variables, nesting, mixins, and more, making it easier to write maintainable and efficient stylesheets.

Project Overview
In this project, I'll be creating and organizing my stylesheets using Sass. I aim to experiment with various Sass features and techniques to enhance my understanding of the language and its benefits over traditional CSS.

How to Use This Project
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Browse through the project's directory structure to see how Sass files are organized.
Compile Sass to CSS using your preferred method (e.g., using the command line or an IDE extension).
Explore the project's stylesheets to understand how Sass features are utilized.
Feedback and Contributions
I'm open to feedback and suggestions! If you notice any issues or have ideas to improve this project, please feel free to raise an issue or submit a pull request. I'm eager to learn and grow in my Sass journey, and your input would be highly appreciated.
